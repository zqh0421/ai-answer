            f"**Required Criteria:**\n"
            f"1. **Judgment Statement**: Begin by clearly stating whether the student's answer is correct or incorrect.\n"
            f"2. **Explain the Student's Answer with Context**:\n"
            f"   - If incorrect: Provide the correct answer directly to the student, and explain why this answer is correct and why the one they chose is incorrect.\n"
            f"   - If correct: Briefly explain why their choice fits and reference specific elements from the question.\n"
            f"3. **Use Specific Details from the Question**: Connect explanations to concrete elements from the question scenarioâ€”avoid abstract or generalized definitions.\n"
            f"4. **Provide suggestions for further study**: Include at least one strategy to help the student improve on similar future questions.\n"
            f"5. **Clarity and Brevity**: Keep the entire feedback clear, constructive, and under 100 words.\n\n"

            f"  - Use <explanation> tags for detailed reasoning\n"
            f"  - Use <advice> tags for improvement suggestions\n"
            f"  - Use <term explanation='tooltip text'> tags for highlighted terms with tooltips\n"
            f"- IMPORTANT: The structured_feedback field must be valid HTML, not plain text\n"
            f"- You are not required to provide terms all the time, only provide terms when they are necessary for the learner to understand the feedback and improve their answer.\n"
            f"- For term explanation, not just providing the definition, but also provide the context of the term in the feedback, that is resonated with the learner's answer.\n"

        f"- Independent variable (X): The predictor or explanatory variable that you use to predict the dependent variable.\n"
        f"Student's Answer: Simple regression is about the relationship between X and Y.\n"
        f"Step-by-step feedback:\n"
        f"- Task: your answer is partly correct but lacks the full explanation of what simple regression entails. Simple regression isn't just about the relationship between X and Y but about how a linear model is fitted to observed data to predict one variable using the other.\n"
        f"- Process: To improve the answer, you should revisit the content on linear regression and focus on the method used to fit the linear equation to data points. Reviewing the definitions of 'dependent' and 'independent' variables will help.\n"
        f"- Self-regulatory: You should reflect on how to expand your explanation and ensure they include details about the modeling process. ask youself whether you have addressed all the steps involved in simple regression.\n"
        f"- Self: Good effort! You're on the right track, but try to include more details next time. Keep practicing!\n"
        f"- Overall: Yout is on the right track but needs to add more details about the mechanics of fitting a linear equation in simple regression. With more focus, they will improve their understanding.\n"
        f"- Improved Answer: Simple regression models the relationship between X and Y by fitting a linear equation to observed data, where X is the independent variable used to predict Y, the dependent variable.\n\n"

        f"Example 2:\n"
        f"Question: What is Simple Regression?\n"

        f"- Task: Your answer is completely correct!\n"
        f"- Process: To deepen their understanding, you could focus on how the model minimizes errors when fitting the linear equation. Reviewing examples of error minimization strategies may help.\n"
        f"- Self-regulatory: Please reflect on how they can reduce errors in future regression models. Are there ways they can validate their model further?\n"
        f"- Self: Excellent work! You have a strong understanding of simple regression. Keep exploring advanced concepts to sharpen your skills!\n"

        f"- Feedback is usable for learners,be both clear and specific, give explanation, but please do not directly give the right answer if students' response is incorrect.\n "

        f"Step 3: provide actionable information for future learning (i.e., giving suggestion for the tasks, suggest learning skills or strategies).\n"
        f"Step 4: encourage the student's agency (e.g., direct invitations to discuss feedback or performance with the teacher; suggesting that the learner seek help from sources or resources other than the teacher; encouraging the learner to engage in further independent study).\n"
