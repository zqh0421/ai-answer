        f"Here are some examples of feedback:\n"
        f"1. Your answer is quite broad and doesnâ€™t address the specific learning objectives of the course. According to the slides, try focusing on how design principles guide e-learning strategies. This will make your response more relevant and targeted.\n"
        f"2. Your answer is not correct. According to the slides, the link between learning and engineering is an interesting angle, but it needs more substance. Think about what aspects of e-learning design are critical to achieving effective learning outcomes. This could help make your answer more comprehensive.\n"

        f"Example 1:\n"
        f"Question: What is Simple Regression?\n"
        f"PPT Content: Simple regression, also known as simple linear regression, is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The two variables in simple regression are:\n"
        f"- Dependent variable (Y): The outcome or response variable that you are trying to predict or explain.\n" 
        f"- Independent variable (X): The predictor or explanatory variable that you use to predict the dependent variable.\n"
        f"Student's Answer: Simple regression is about the relationship between X and Y.\n"
        f"Step-by-step feedback:\n"
        f"- Task: your answer is partly correct but lacks the full explanation of what simple regression entails. Simple regression isn't just about the relationship between X and Y but about how a linear model is fitted to observed data to predict one variable using the other.\n"
        f"- Process: To improve the answer, you should revisit the content on linear regression and focus on the method used to fit the linear equation to data points. Reviewing the definitions of 'dependent' and 'independent' variables will help.\n"
        f"- Self-regulatory: You should reflect on how to expand your explanation and ensure they include details about the modeling process. ask youself whether you have addressed all the steps involved in simple regression.\n"
        f"- Self: Good effort! You're on the right track, but try to include more details next time. Keep practicing!\n"
        f"- Overall: Yout is on the right track but needs to add more details about the mechanics of fitting a linear equation in simple regression. With more focus, they will improve their understanding.\n"
        f"- Improved Answer: Simple regression models the relationship between X and Y by fitting a linear equation to observed data, where X is the independent variable used to predict Y, the dependent variable.\n\n"

        f"Example 2:\n"
        f"Question: What is Simple Regression?\n"
        f"PPT Content: Simple regression, also known as simple linear regression, is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The two variables in simple regression are:\n"

        f"Student's Answer: Simple regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. The two variables in simple regression are Dependent variable (Y) and Independent variable (X).\n"
        f"Step-by-step feedback:\n"
        f"- Task: Your answer is completely correct!\n"
        f"- Process: To deepen their understanding, you could focus on how the model minimizes errors when fitting the linear equation. Reviewing examples of error minimization strategies may help.\n"
        f"- Self-regulatory: Please reflect on how they can reduce errors in future regression models. Are there ways they can validate their model further?\n"
        f"- Self: Excellent work! You have a strong understanding of simple regression. Keep exploring advanced concepts to sharpen your skills!\n"
        f"- Overall: Your answer is accurate.  Next, you should explore how errors can be minimized when fitting the linear model to data.\n"
        f"- Improved Answer: No need, the answer is already correct.\n"

        f"feedback content needs to meet the requirements of the below feedback characteristics\n"
        f"- Feedback encourages positive learner affect (i.e., Positively framed feedback comments are known to enhance learner self-efficacy and motivation).\n"
        f"- Feedback is usable for learners,be both clear and specific, give explanation, but please do not directly give the right answer if students' response is incorrect.\n "
        f"- Feedback needs to strengthen teacher and learner relationships,for instance, including a brief relational comment to display recognition and value of the individual learner behind the piece of work\n "
        f"- Feedback needs to invite dialogue about feedback, promote learner independence (i.e., invite students to ask question from teachers; invite dialogue through text-based feedback comments).\n"
        f"keep theses five requirements of feedback characteristics in mind, and then generate feedback according to following steps:"
        f"Step 1: provide critiques about the student's answer (that is to directly tell the student whether their response is correct or not, and give the reason). Please provide a strict evaluation based on the text of the provided slides.\n"
        f"Step 2: highlight the strengths of the student's answer (i.e., praise student in some aspect according to their response).\n"
        f"Step 3: provide actionable information for future learning (i.e., giving suggestion for the tasks, suggest learning skills or strategies).\n"
        f"Step 4: encourage the student's agency (e.g., direct invitations to discuss feedback or performance with the teacher; suggesting that the learner seek help from sources or resources other than the teacher; encouraging the learner to engage in further independent study).\n"
        f"The output should be a single paragraph containing less than 4 sentences.\n"
        f"Note: Please provide the feedback in a single paragraph without mentioning any 'components'.\n\n"
